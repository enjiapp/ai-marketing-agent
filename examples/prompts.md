Business name: Serenity Yoga

Here's a review from a happy customer:

```

---

## Brand Development

### Define Your Voice

```
"Analyze this copy from my website and create a brand voice guide for me:

'Hey there! We're not your typical accounting firm. Sure, we'll handle your taxes 
and bookkeeping, but we actually make it fun (or at least bearable). No jargon, 
no judgment, just real talk about your numbers. We get that you started a business 
to do what you love, not to stress about spreadsheets. Let us handle the boring 
stuff so you can get back to being awesome.'"
```

Your AI client uses `brand_voice` to analyze tone, style, and voice characteristics.

## Troubleshooting & Refinement

### When Initial Results Aren't Perfect

**Too Generic:**
```
"The blog ideas you generated are too generic. Let me give you more details about my business:

I'm a nutritionist who specializes in gut health and works exclusively with women 
over 40 dealing with digestive issues. My approach combines evidence-based nutrition 
with mindfulness practices. Generate blog topics that reflect this specific niche."
```

**Need More Context:**
```
"Great start! Now let's get more specific. My target customers are:
- Women 40-60 years old
- Have tried multiple diets without success
- Frustrated with bloating, IBS, or food sensitivities
- Looking for sustainable solutions, not quick fixes
- Value natural, holistic approaches

Regenerate the blog ideas with this in mind."
```

## Pro Tips
